Help the docs
===

If you want to help develop the documentation,
join our discord, https://discord.gg/MttV6XVwTQ and acquire the position to see Koyn's channels,
after that go to ``#roles-koyn`` and get the role of Beta Tester,
after that go to the ``#Beta-tools`` channel and ask for access to write pages in the bot's documentation.
